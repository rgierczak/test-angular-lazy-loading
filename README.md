# test-angular-lazy-loading

> This application shows lazy loading mechanism of angular modules.
 The benefit of this feature is not to loading entire application (all components) once it is bootstrapped,
 but only the particular component which is needed to be displayed - for example only home component.
 Thanks to that feature, it is possible to make application initial bundle file smaller, which causes faster application loading.

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ npm run start
```

```
